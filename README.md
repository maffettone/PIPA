# Prior Information Protein folding Algorithm
Bayesian approach for information poor structure determination as highlighted by protein tertiary structure determination from an NMR prior and total scattering based likelihood. The algorithm is a Bayesian reverse Monte Carlo. 

The program, PIPA, has been developed in a proof-of-concept study to demon- strate its potential with the protein melittin. Using this protein with simulated data, I parameterize the program for use and discuss the utility of particular types of prior information. When considering an ensemble of structure refinements, the algorithm effectively discriminates sensible structure predictions from other ensem- ble members by using the Ï‡2 parameter. In considering the models in isolation, the approach suffers from a lack of precision, but could potentially be used as a starting configuration in molecular dynamics. This opens the opportunity for inclusion of other information sources, while still demonstrating the pair distribution function as having sufficient information content to determine the overall tertiary structure of a protein. Combined with sparse chemical shift data, this work demonstrates a facile solution phase probe into protein structural solution, bringing the community one step closer to effective understanding of challenging proteins, especially membrane proteins.
